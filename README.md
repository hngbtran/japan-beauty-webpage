This is my final project for the [WD4E CSS course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introcss/).

The website is about Japan and its beauty in culture and nature. I used a <span style="color:#e0667a">pastel pink</span> and <span style="color:#45838b">green</span> theme to give it a fresh, spring vibe.

I haven’t learned JavaScript yet, so the site is mostly for displaying information. However, you can still try some small interactions like hovering over elements or holding your mouse click on certain images.

I hope you enjoy the theme and feel of the website!

*I plan to update it as soon as I learn new things, especially JavaScript, so I can add more features and interactions in the future.*
